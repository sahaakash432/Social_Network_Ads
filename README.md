Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is particularly effective in handling
high-dimensional data and is known for its ability to create non-linear decision boundaries.

In SVM, the algorithm aims to find an optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes or predicts the continuous values in regression. 
The hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points of each class.
The data points that are closest to the hyperplane and influence its position are called support vectors.


Here are the key components and concepts associated with SVM:

Hyperplane: In SVM, the hyperplane is the decision boundary that separates the data points into different classes. For instance, in binary classification, 
it is a line in a two-dimensional space, a plane in a three-dimensional space, or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces.

Support Vectors: These are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane and have the maximum influence on its position. They play a crucial role in defining the 
decision boundary.

Kernel Functions: SVM can efficiently handle non-linear classification tasks by using kernel functions. Kernel functions transform the input data into a higher-dimensional
feature space, where a linear hyperplane can be used to separate the transformed data points. Examples of kernel functions include the linear kernel, polynomial kernel,
and radial basis function (RBF) kernel.

Soft Margin: In some cases, it may not be possible to find a hyperplane that perfectly separates all the data points. SVM allows for a soft margin, which permits
some misclassifications by introducing a penalty for data points that fall within the margin or on the wrong side of the hyperplane. 
This helps achieve a balance between maximizing the margin and controlling errors.

C Parameter: The C parameter is a regularization parameter in SVM that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification errors.
A smaller C value allows for a wider margin with more misclassifications, while a larger C value enforces a stricter margin with fewer misclassifications.

SVM has several advantages, including its ability to handle high-dimensional data, handle non-linear decision boundaries through kernel functions, and its 
effectiveness in dealing with small to medium-sized datasets. However, SVM can be computationally expensive for large datasets, and the choice of the appropriate
kernel and tuning parameters can be critical for optimal performance.

SVM has various extensions, such as support vector regression (SVR) for regression tasks and support vector domain description (SVDD) for anomaly detection.
